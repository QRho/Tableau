Welcome to the Citibike Report
Here we will begin to analyze a three year peroid of bike pass sales.
We can explore the success of both the 3-Day & 24 Hour Pass. 
To start we will look into the lower performing 3-Day pass.
As you can see there has been a dramatic increase in sales of the 3-Day pass from 2016 to 2018.

Notice: Q3 Takes the cake in each year, yeilding the highest number of sold passes. 

# The first two pages of dot diagrams can be opened up further by clicking on the + button on the left label Called YEAR OF DATE.
Under year of date you can explore the data by year, month and quarter. 
For each year you will see the answer to the questions: 

1.) Which is the most popular type of Pass?

2.) During which Quarter are the most passes sold?

# This leads us to the next flat slide showing the percentage of 3-Day and 24 Hour Passes.

3.) Is there a trend or pattern in the ammount of 3-Day versus 24-Hour passes? 

4.) Does 2019 show any unique trends? 

# This next slide shows a graph with a DOUBLE AXIS! Showcasing the 2 beginning quarters of 2019

This ellaborates on the trend seen in the flat chart showing the slight decrease in 3-Day passes and the all time rise in 24-Hour passes.

# Next Slide is Q1 and Q2 of 2019. 

# Then there is a dashboard detailing the most popular Quarters and answering Questions.

# Following Slides are a breakdown of the 10 most popular START and END locations. 
With explainer text on accompnaing dashboard. 

Then we conclude on the density map that shows in tool tips the START and END station locations as well as trip duration. 
Similarally, the END location map has scattered locations that reach farther and extend farther out of METRO Manhattan. 
(Took quite a bit of time to load the one so I thought I would leave it at that.) All other data can be accesed through the see data function in Tableau.

It took  quite a while to clean and organize the data in a CSV before I loaded it into Tableau. 
I used the 2018, May section of Station info for the calculations based on the findings in main dataset.
